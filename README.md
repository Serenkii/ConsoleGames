# ConsoleGames
ConsoleGames is a small Java project.  It includes some basic games which can all (only) be played using the console.
Current games include Rock, Paper, Scissors and Tic Tac Toe. Although Tic Tac Toe is a bit messy at the moment.
Later these games may be added: Hangman, Connect Four, maybe some sort of a chat bot. Hopefully I will have some more ideas which can be feasibly accomplished in Java without GUI.
